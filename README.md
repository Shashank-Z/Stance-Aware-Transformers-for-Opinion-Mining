# Stance-Aware-Transformers-for-Opinion-Mining
◦ Developed and compared Siamese and Triplet networks to enhance a sentence transformer’s ability to
differentiate between opposing "Pro" and "Con" arguments in opinion mining.
◦ Fine-tuned a sentence-transformer using Cosine Similarity and Triplet Loss functions on the Kialo debate corpus,
implementing the entire data processing and training pipeline in Python with PyTorch.
◦ Achieved superior performance with the Triplet Network, which increased the accuracy of the stance classification
to 85. 4% and the F1 score to 86. 3%, successfully separating previously overlapping semantic distributions.
